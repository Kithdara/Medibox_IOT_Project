Medibox is a smart IoT device designed to help users manage their medications effectively. The device is
a box-like structure that can be easily placed on a table or mounted on a wall. It has a sleek and modern
design with a transparent cover that allows users to see the contents of the box.
Medibox comes equipped with several features that make it a valuable asset for managing medication
schedules. The device has a built-in LCD that shows the date, time, and upcoming medication schedule.
The device also has a speaker that provides audible reminders to take medication at the scheduled time.
Medibox has an easy-to-use interface that allows users to input medication information, dosage, and
schedule. The device has multiple compartments that can be labeled and assigned to different medications.
The compartments are also fitted with sensors that detect whether medication has been removed or not,
ensuring accurate tracking of medication intake.
In addition to its core features, Medibox can also be connected to the internet and synchronized
with a Node-RED Dashboard. This enables users to receive notifications on their mobile devices, track
medication history, set commands, and share information with healthcare professionals.
